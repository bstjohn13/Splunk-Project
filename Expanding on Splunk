What is Splunk?

Splunk is a type of SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) A SIEM is a software that provides a 
central pool of data from multiple sources, this data can be reviewed and queried by an analyst.

There are three primary ways to use a SIEM
Threat detection
Investigation
Time to respond

There is alot of other useful ways to use Splunk other than what I have demonstrated here as well!
