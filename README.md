Step 1: Create a report to determine the impact that the DDOS attack had on download and upload speed. Additionally, create an additional field to calculate the ratio of the upload speed to the download speed.

We can see in or chart and our stats when the attacked started because of the sudden decline of Upload megabits and when our systems recover.
The attack started at 2/23/20 11:30PM
Our systems started recovering around 8:30PM and fully recovered at 11:30PM
Our systems were down for about 8-10.
