# Splunk-Project
Utilize your Splunk skills to design a powerful monitoring solution to protect Vandaly from security attacks.

As the worldwide leader of importing and exporting, Vandalay Industries has been the target of many adversaries attempting to disrupt their online business. Recently, Vandaly has been experiencing DDOS attacks against their web servers.

Not only were web servers taken offline by a DDOS attack, but upload and download speed were also significantly impacted after the outage. Your networking team provided results of a network speed run around the time of the latest DDOS attack.

Upload file into Splunk.

Create a report to determine the impact that the DDOS attack had on download and upload speed. Additionally, create an additional field to calculate the ratio of the upload speed to the download speed.

Step 1: Create a report to determine the impact that the DDOS attack had on download and upload speed. Additionally, create an additional field to calculate the ratio of the upload speed to the download speed.

We can see in or chart and our stats when the attacked started because of the sudden decline of Upload megabits and when our systems recover.
The attack started at 2/23/20 11:30PM
Our systems started recovering around 8:30PM and fully recovered at 11:30PM
Our systems were down for about 8-10.
